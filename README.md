# Joshua Johnson

**Data Engineer & Researcher**  
I design and optimize enterprise-grade data systems, bridging legacy platforms with modern analytics and AI. My work integrates hands-on engineering with theoretical inquiry, aiming to bring rigor and clarity to both domains.

## Professional Focus
- **Data Engineering & Analytics**: SQL Server, DB2 (AS/400), ETL pipelines, SSRS dashboards
- **Software Development**: Python automation, C#/.NET, Java backend systems
- **Systems Integration**: API development, SFTP workflows, orchestration with SSIS and Python
- **Applied AI**: Machine learning for logistics optimization, data quality, and forecasting

## Research Interests
- Quantum-inspired algorithms for ETL and optimization
- Quantum differential geometry as a new framework for data spaces
- Neural networks for predictive analytics in transportation and beyond
- Formal verification methods (TLA+) for data pipeline reliability

## Current Work
I am employed as a Data Engineer, building and maintaining pipelines that unify operational data, support financial forecasting, and feed enterprise reporting systems. My role blends DBA responsibilities with analytics and emerging AI/ML applications.

## Academic Path
- B.S. in Computer Science
- Pursuing graduate studies in Data Science and Machine Learning, with a planned PhD focus on **quantum machine learning** and **quantum data engineering**.
